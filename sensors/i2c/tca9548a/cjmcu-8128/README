# CJMCU-8128 Module Breakout

The CJMCU-8128 is a small breakout board available at Banggood.com or
Aliexpress. It comes with 3 main sensors onboard including:

* BMP280 - pressure & temperature
* HDC10XX - humidity & temperature
* CCS811 - CO2 & Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) index

The breakout board communicates using i2c and therefore all sensors
can be accesssed via that protocol simply by connecting up the SDA, SCL,
VCC and GND pins on the sensor.

## Getting Started

Each of the included submodules in this repo caters to one of the included
submodules on the board. By cloning the rpeo and submodules then checking
each submodule you wiulkl find example code to test each section fo the board.

An example script is alos provided in the root of the project which
combines the 3 libraries into one.

## Prerequisities

Python 2.7+

## Running the tests

No tests are provided iun thre root project but you may find tests for
each sensor in their respective libraries along with examples of
their use.
